# HumanShapeNetworks

### A CNN trained to recognize the human shape PCA parameters.
### Example inputs are included in data file. 
### The output of the network is a 20 dimension vector which numbers correspond to PCA eigenvectors weights. 
### For details of the method, please check the paper "HS-Nets : Estimating Human Body Shape from Silhouettes with Convolutional
Neural Networks".
### For data generation, please contact.
